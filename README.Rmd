# qualtrics-viz

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

qualtrics-viz is a Shiny app that imports, processes, and visualizes Qualtrics survey data. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://res.cloudinary.com/dn83gtg0l/image/upload/v1665605093/qualtricsviz.png")
```


The app leverages the [qsurvey](https://github.com/jamesdunham/qsurvey) and [qualtRics](https://github.com/JasperHG90/qualtRics) packages to ingest the data via the Qualtrics API and extract questions and choices. The app can currently process and visualize multiple choice, matrix, pick-group-rank, bipolar, rank order, slider, and drilldown question types. 

### Single Question Summary

For many of the question types, plot colors can be changed via the `colorSelectorInput` widget from [dreamRs/shinyWidgets](https://shinyapps.dreamrs.fr/shinyWidgets/). 

All plots can be downloaded and resized as necessary. 

All question data is also rendered in a [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/) table. Formatting of the table is dependent on question type and determined internally. Tables are downloaded via a screenshot using the [dreamRs/capture](https://github.com/dreamRs/capture) function. 

### Crosstabs 

Crosstabs have been added to the app. Currently all presentation of the data is in a gt table only. The **Group** variable is in the column while the **Target** variable is found in the rows. Group levels can be filtered out of the table. If the the Target question type is either Matrix, Rank Order, or Pick, Group, Rank then the Target groupings can also be filtered.
